A pangram is a sentence where every letter of the English alphabet appears at least once.

Given a string sentence containing only lowercase English letters, return

true if sentence is a pangram, or false otherwise.

To get a ascii character a
Use => chr(ord('a') + 0)


Python String find() method returns the lowest index or first occurrence of the substring
if it is found in a given string. If it is not found, then it returns -1.

Syntax: str_obj.find(sub, start, end)

Parameters:

sub: Substring that needs to be searched in the given string.
start (optional): Starting position where the substring needs to be checked within the string.
end (optional): End position is the index of the last value for the specified range. It is excluded while checking.
Return:  Returns the lowest index of the substring if it is found in a given string. If itâ€™s not found then it returns -1.
